Requirements met:
ðŸŽ¯ Set up user sign-up and user login using Clerk.
ðŸŽ¯ Enable users to create a user profile, and input profile information (such as a user biography) using a form. Users and user information should be stored in their own table in the database and handled with an appropriate route (e.g. /user/[userId]).
ðŸŽ¯ Enable users to create posts associated with their Clerk userId. Posts should be displayed on the userâ€™s profile page.

Requirements not met:
ðŸŽ¯ Create and display an error page if the user visits a user profile that doesnâ€™t exist
 - To do this I would create a page to display a 404 error message
 - Conditionally render the page using an if statement inside the profile page export function. 

ðŸŽ¯ Use 1 or more Radix UI Primitive or something similar (e.g. use of another library to enhance UX).
- I didn't tackle these requirements in time, as I got stuck integrating clerk and user's id for creating posts.

Challenges I faced:

Using props to pass around arguments and server actions.

Separating client and server components was difficult as postForm.jsx uses a server action to submit posts. I used props to pass the server action to the client component: https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/server-actions-and-mutations#client-components.

Passing the id from the dynamic route for posts into the server action using hidden input fields. https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/server-actions-and-mutations. Important to note that this method should not be used for passing user sensitive information (e.g. user_id).

Obtaining the clerk id for a server action. https://clerk.com/docs/references/nextjs/server-actions.
