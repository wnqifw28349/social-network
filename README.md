Requirements not met:
ðŸŽ¯ Create and display an error page if the user visits a user profile that doesnâ€™t exist.
ðŸŽ¯ Use 1 or more Radix UI Primitive or something similar (e.g. use of another library to enhance UX).

Challenges I faced:

Using props to pass around arguments and server actions.

Separating client and server components was difficult as postForm.jsx uses a server action to submit posts. I used props to pass the server action to the client component: https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/server-actions-and-mutations#client-components.

Passing the id from the dynamic route for posts into the server action using hidden input fields. https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/server-actions-and-mutations. Important to note that this method should not be used for passing user sensitive information (e.g. user_id).

Obtaining the clerk id for a server action. https://clerk.com/docs/references/nextjs/server-actions.
